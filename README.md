# Ft_printf

This is the second project of the **`42Cursus`**. <br />
The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. recoding `printf()` (not the whole function).

**```Note: I haven't shared the PDF of this project, as well as, I haven't explained anything due to school privacy reasons!```**

This project consists of two parts:
- **Mandatory part**
- **Bonus Part**

> Note: The **Bonus Part** is not that necessary to validate the project, but it gives some extra XPs and spreads **`The Blackhole`**.

# Mandatory Part

In order to implement your own `printf()` you need to go over each one of this string formats:

  - `%c` Prints a single character.
  - `%s` Prints a string (as defined by the common C convention).
  - `%p` The void * pointer argument has to be printed in hexadecimal format.
  - `%d` Prints a decimal (base 10) number.
  - `%i` Prints an integer in base 10.
  - `%u` Prints an unsigned decimal (base 10) number.
  - `%x` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) lowercase format.
  - `%X` Prints a number in hexadecimal (base 16) uppercase format.
  â€¢-`%%` Prints a percent sign.

# What are variadic functions

In order to have this project done you must learn a new `C Concept` which is **`Variadic Functions`**.

in `C Programming Language` function takes a known number of params to deal with, but what if we want to pass an unknown number of params and let the function handle all of them? it's cool right :)?

_with `Variadic Functions` this problem would be fixed._

Here is how to declare a `Variadic Function` that takes a variable number of params:

```c
void variadic_function(char *s, ...)
```

let's break this example down so we can see what this weird function does.

first of all, this function returns nothing, the first parameter is a string but the second one `...` is something to declare to the function that we are about to accept a variable number of params.

learn more about `Variadic Functions` via [`Variadic Functions in c`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variadic-functions-in-c/#:~:text=Variadic%20functions%20are%20functions%20that,of%20arguments%20can%20be%20passed.)
